    <p className="info">
      A calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers.
      Basic calculators can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication and
      division mathematical calculations.
      However, more sophisticated calculators can handle exponential operations,
      square roots, logarithms, trigonometric functions and hyperbolic functions. Internally,
      some calculators perform all these functions by repeated addition processes.
